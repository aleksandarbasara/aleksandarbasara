## What I Do

I help organizations make smarter technical bets — by separating the hype from the infrastructure.

### At Neural Assembly:
- 🧭 AI consulting, education & PoCs  
- 🛠️ Focused work with LLMs, agents, and edge intelligence  
- 🎓 Teaching teams how to actually build, not just experiment

### At Valanor:
- 🏗️ Modern data stack advisory (BigQuery, Databricks, dbt)  
- 📦 E-commerce infrastructure & analytics  
- 📊 Execution-focused, tech-agnostic data strategy

## What I Believe

- Buzzwords aren’t architecture.  
- Most PoCs are a waste of time.  
- Your system should make sense to the people running it.

Whether you're building an inference pipeline or choosing between Snowflake and BigQuery — clarity comes first.

> **Foundations before futures. Always.**
